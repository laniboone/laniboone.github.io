            Biography
        *got a lot to achieve bud*

        1. **Personal background:** I've lived in Greensboro, NC almost all my life. I moved schools a lot until 7th grade where I attended Eastern Guilford and stayed until graduation. I haven't travelled much, but it's definitely in my future. I'm eager to get out and explore while learning about all the new people I meet!
        2. **Professional background:** I have experience as an Administrative Intern with a wellness center for alcohol and drug abuse.
        2. **Academic background:** I obtained my high school diploma in June 2020. I'll never stop learning.
        3. **Information/Technology background:**I always enjoyed working with robotics and any hands-on STEM project that I could get my.. hands on!! I see the benefits of technology and look forward to the future. Who knows, I may come up with something cool!
        4. **Background in the subject matter of this course:** I took my first CS course in my first semester of college. It was rough for me because everything was new and virtual. I am excited for all the progress I'll make in my ITCS 3135 class. I am learning that I know more than I realize, and it's just a matter of brushing up on the basics and building off of them!
        5. **Primary computer platform:** Macbook Air for now! I would love to do my coding on a windows computer, though. I'll check for my preferences later. Right now, she's doing me just fine.
        6. **Reason for taking each course:**
        - ITCS 3135 - WEB DEVELOPMENT:
        - I want to learn to build my own website for personal/business branding purposes.
        - ITSC 2175 - LOGIC AND ALGORITHMS:
        - This is a required course for my Cybersecurity B.S.
        - PSYCH 1101 - PSYCHOLOGY:
        - This class is an interesting elective, I think the perspectives gained from completing the coursework will benefit my approach to making connections and networking.
        - ITCS 3160 - DATABASE DESIGN AND IMPLEM:
        - This class is teaching me essential basics for Cybersecurity. In order to protect and secure a database, I must know what a database is and the features of it.
        - MATH 1242 - CALCULUS 2:
        - Math has always been my most proficient subject, however, I didn't pass the AP Calculus exam. So I started back with college algebra and am building my way back up.
        7. **Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:** Every time that I rode the biggest water slide at Great Wolf Lodge with my friends, we'd fight and jump off the floatie thing!! It opened up my daring side and now I wonder what other fun risks I'll take.
        8. **I'd also like to share:** I am really friendly most of the time, so by chance, if you're reading this... YOU'RE A BUD
